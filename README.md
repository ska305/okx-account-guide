## What is OKX?

**OKX** (formerly OKEx) launched back in 2017 and has grown into one of the world's top crypto exchanges by trading volume. Based in Seychelles, it's not just another trading platformâ€”it's a full ecosystem supporting spot trading, derivatives, staking, DeFi products, and Web3 tools.

Originally part of OK Group (which also includes OKCoin), OKX has carved out its own identity with bank-level security infrastructure including:

- Cold storage for the majority of user assets
- Multi-signature wallet protection
- Two-factor authentication (2FA)
- Real-time monitoring systems

### What Makes OKX Stand Out?

The platform packs an impressive range of features:

**Spot Trading** â€“ Trade hundreds of tokens across countless pairs. Whether you're buying Bitcoin or exploring obscure altcoins, the liquidity's solid.

**Futures & Perpetual Contracts** â€“ For those who want leverage, OKX offers derivative products with high multipliers. Not for the faint of heart, but the tools are there.

**Earn** â€“ Your crypto doesn't have to sit idle. Stake it, save it, or throw it into farming pools to generate passive income.

**Web3 Wallet** â€“ A non-custodial wallet supporting multiple chains including EVM networks, Solana, and Bitcoin. Your keys, your coins.

**NFT Marketplace** â€“ Buy, sell, or mint NFTs directly within the platform. No need to jump to OpenSea every time.

**Copy Trading** â€“ Not sure how to trade? Follow professional traders and automatically copy their moves. Learn by watching.

### User Experience

The iOS, Android, and web apps all feature clean, modern interfaces that don't overwhelm beginners. Vietnamese language support makes it especially convenient for Vietnamese traders. Customer support runs 24/7 with quick response timesâ€”helpful when you're troubleshooting at 2 AM.
